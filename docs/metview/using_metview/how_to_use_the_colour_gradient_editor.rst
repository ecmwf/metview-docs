How to use the colour gradient editor
/////////////////////////////////////

Colour gradients offer an easy way to define stunning colour schemes for
contour plotting. The idea behind the colour gradients is that we just
define a few waypoints representing certain colours then the colours
between the waypoints are automatically generated with a given
interpolation method and resolution.

Enable gradient shading
=======================

To enable the colour gradient mode in the
:ref:`Contouring <mcont_icon>`
icon we need to use contour shading and set the **Contour Shade Colour
Method** to "Gradients". This is how it looks in
the :ref:`Contouring <mcont_icon>`
icon editor:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image1.png
   :width: 3.95833in
   :height: 0.96142in

Having set this we need to scroll further down in the icon editor to
find the gradient settings. This is what we can see by default:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image2.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.04023in

Start editing
=============

To edit **Contour Gradients Colour List** open its helper by clicking on
the << button:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image3.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.706in

By default the gradient list only contains one waypoint. Using the

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image4.png
   :width: 0.30208in
   :height: 0.32292in

button we can add a new waypoint to the right of the current one and
change its colour (e.g. to red) using the colour wheel:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image5.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.88662in

With the current settings the gradient was generated by linear
interpolation in the **RGB** colour space (see **Colour Gradients
Technique**) with 10 steps between the two waypoints (see **Colour
Gradients Steps List**).

.. note::

    This is the full list of actions implemented for the colour        
    gradient editor ("cell" here means waypoint):                      
                                                                       
    .. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image6.png                                        
       :width: 2.69229in                                               
       :height: 2.10417in                                              

Gradient techniques
===================

There are other gradient techniques available on top of the RGB-base
one  (this is the default). These are as follows:

-  **HCL**: the interpolation is done in the Hue-Chroma-Lightness colour
   space

-  **HSL**: the interpolation is done in the Hue-Saturation-Lightness
   colour space

Both in the HCL and HSL spaces we can choose an interpolation direction
along the colour wheel (hue values). The can be done by setting using
**Contour Gradients Technique Direction** either to clockwise or
anticlockwise. 

This is how our gradient would look by setting the technique to "HCL"
and the direction to "clockwise":

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image7.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.97883in

and this is how with the "HSL" technique and "clockwise" direction:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image8.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 2.00801in

Waypoint methods
================

So far we have only had two waypoints. If we add a new waypoint in the
middle and sets its colour (e.g. to yellow) we will see something like
this (with the "RGB" technique):

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image9.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.88885in

Note that the colour of the waypoint in the middle is used both in the
left and right gradient segment. This happens because we set **Colour
Gradient Waypoint Method** to "both". The other options are as follows:

-  ignore: the waypoint colour is omitted from both segments

-  left: the waypoint colour is only used in the left segment

-  right. the waypoint colour is only used in right segment

E.g. by setting this option to "left" we would generate this gradient:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image10.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.92073in

Changing the resolution
=======================

The gradient resolution can be set for each segment independently by
using a list for **Colour Gradients Steps List**. E.g. by setting it to
"10/30" we can generate something like this where the second segment is
almost continuous:

.. image:: /_static/ug/how_to_use_the_colour_gradient_editor/image11.png
   :width: 5.90069in
   :height: 1.99475in

.. warning::

    Please use the **Colour Gradients Steps List** with extra care     
    because although smooth gradients look great but the memory and    
    time needed to generate the plot can increase significantly.       

Mapping the waypoints to contour values
=======================================

The gradient editor is only dealing with waypoints and is decoupled from
the actual values the waypoints are mapped to. The first waypoint is
simply mapped to the first contour value, the second waypoint is to the
second value and so on.
