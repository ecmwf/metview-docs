Using Metview
==============

.. note::
   Metview consists of a graphical user interface, a Python API and a Macro programming language.
   The user interface can be used to interactively explore and process data, and also to automate some of the
   writing of Python or Macro scripts. Python and Macro offer much the same functionality, with Python offering
   some extra features not available in Macro. Python and Macro scripts can be run either from the command line
   or from within the user interface. Python scripts can also be called from within any Python environment simply
   by importing the metview package.
