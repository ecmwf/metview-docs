Interactive Weather Symbols
==================================

Interactive Weather Symbols are a collection of weather symbol and annotation objects that can be interactively added to and then edited in the Metview plot window. These objects are projection aware and will survive plot updates such as
zooming, changes of projection and contouring. 

Each Interactive Weather Symbol is represented by a Metview icon (see :ref:`here <toc_plot_ws>` the full list of icons). Using the icons the symbols can be saved from the Metview plot window for later reuse. These icons can also be directly visualised or dragged into the plot window. Plotting from a script (Python or Macro) also works but it requires a Metview installation with the GUI component enabled.
