FLEXTRA setup
/////////////

What Metview version is required?
=================================

Metview versions **5.0.0**. or later are required.

What FLEXTRA version is required?
=================================

Only version **5.0** is supported.

.. note::

    Please note that FLEXTRA is not an ECMWF development. FLEXTRA is   
    *not distributed* with Metview, but it has to be installed         
    separately. Please visit the following website for installation    
    instructions: https://www.flexpart.eu.                             

How to specify the FLEXTRA executable in Metview?
=================================================

In Metview we can run FLEXTRA using :func:`flextra_run`. The
FLEXTRA executable is either defined via the ``flextra_exe_path``
parameter in this function or via theÂ  **MV_FLEXTRA_EXE** environment
variable (this has to be set before starting up Metview).

Code modifications
==================

To make FLEXTRA work with ECMWF data the following modifications has to
be made in the source code:
