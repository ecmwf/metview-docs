- subpage_clipping:
    default: 'off'
    desc: Clips plot to subpage borders.
    ptype: str
    values: on/off
- subpage_x_position:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the X offset of the plot from the left side of the plot frame
      (any subdivision of the display area). This is expressed as a percentage of
      the X-dimension of the plot frame.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_position:
    default: '0'
    desc: Specifies the Y offset of the plot from the bottom side of the plot frame
      (any subdivision of the display area). This is expressed as a percentage of
      the Y-dimension of the plot frame.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_x_length:
    default: '100'
    desc: Specifies the X length of the plot. This is expressed as a percentage of
      the X-dimension of the plot frame. Hence the sum of this X length plus the X
      offset cannot exceed 100 (it is advised that it does not exceed 95 since you
      need some margin on the right for things like axis or map grid labels).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_length:
    default: '100'
    desc: Same as ``subpage_x_length`` but for the Y length of the plot.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
