return: :class:`NetCDF`
summary: rst
oneliner: Provides input for Hovemoeller diagrams derived from
  an input geographical area and a set of levels.
params:
- data:
    default: 
    desc: Specifies the input GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) for the Hovmeller diagram. 
      ``data`` must contain a time-series of a single meteorological variable on a latitude-longitude
      or Gaussian grid, on a set of vertical levels. If ``data`` is specified on ECMWF model levels and ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure" ``data`` must also contain an Logarithm of Surface Pressure (LNSP) field (see ``lnsp_param``) for each step, otherwise the pressure on the model levels cannot be computed. 
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values:
- area:
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- lnsp_param:
    default: '152'
    desc: Specifies the ecCodes paramId used to identify the Logarithm of Surface Pressure (LNSP) in the input data.  Enabled when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure". 
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- vertical_level_type:
   default: as_in_data
   desc: Specifies if a conversion from ECMWF model levels to pressure levels needs
     to be performed.
   ptype: str
   values: 'as_in_data/pressure' 
- vertical_coordinate_extrapolate:
    default: 'off'
    desc: Performs and extrapolation for the ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` when the pressure level range derived from the input models levels does not contain these levels. Only used whe ``data`` contains model levels and ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure".
    ptype: str
    values: on/off
- bottom_level:
    default: '1100.0'
    desc: Specifies the lower (closest to the surface) limit of the Hovmoeller data as a pressure value (hPa) when ``data`` contains model levels and ``vertical_level_type`` is pressure. Enabled when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- top_level:
    default: '0.01'
    desc: Specifies the upper (furthest from the surface) limit of the Hovmoeller data as a pressure value (hPa) when ``data`` contains model levels and ``vertical_level_type`` is pressure. Enabled when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure".
    ptype: number
