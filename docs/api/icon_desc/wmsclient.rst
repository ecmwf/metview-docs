Implements a WMS (Web Map Service) client.

.. note:: :func:`wmsclient` was primarily developed for Metview's user interface where it (as an icon) has a specialised editor that allows to inspect the GetCapabilities request and build and visualise the GetMap request. See the `Metview WMS Tutorial <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/METV/Metview+WMS+Tutorial>`_ for details.
