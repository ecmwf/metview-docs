return: Metview object representing the type of the downloaded data.
summary: Downloads a file from a given URL. By default the result is cached, but a
  target path can also be specified in order to save the file directly 
  to a given location. This is particularly useful for data types that Metview does
  not have specific support for. 
oneliner: Downloads a file from a given URL. 
params:
- url:
    default: ''
    desc: Provide a URL that will return a file. This can be, for instance, a
      URL that points directly to a particular file, or a request to a web service
      that generates and returns some data.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- target:
    default: ''
    desc: This parameter is optional. If set, the downloaded file will be copied
      to the given location. The target path can be absolute or relative, but
      must include the file name, and the parent directory must already exist. If
      running from an interactive session, a relative path will be relative to the
      folder containing the script; when running in batch mode, the path will be
      relative to where the :command:`metview` command was run from.  
    ptype: str
    values: ''
example: >-
    import metview as mv
         
    # download the data and assign to a variable 
    data = mv.download(url="http://download.ecmwf.org/test-data/metview/gallery/2m_temperature.grib") 
    print('Values range from ', minvalue(data), ' to ', maxvalue(data)) 
    mv.write('local_copy_of_file.grib', data)  
      
    # example which uses target to directly save the file 
    mv.download(url="http://download.ecmwf.org/test-data/grib_api/data/budg.md5",
                target="local_md5.txt")
