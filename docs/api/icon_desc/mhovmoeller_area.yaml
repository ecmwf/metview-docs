return: :class:`NetCDF`
summary: rst
oneliner: Provides input for Hovmoeller diagrams derived from a geographical area.
params:
- data:
    default: 
    desc: Specifies the GRIB data (:class:`Fieldset`) from which to derive the Hovmeller diagram. 
      ``data`` must specify a time-series of one meteorological variable on a given level on a latitude-longitude or Gaussian grid. Multiple parameters/levels are not supported. 
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values:
- area:
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated.
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- area_statistics:
    default: 'average'
    desc: Specifies the type of computation performed along the `average_direction``. For "average", "stdev" or "variance" when ``average_direction`` is "north_south" the aggregation is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
    ptype: str
    values: average/minimum/maximum/stdev/variance/median
- average_direction:
    default: east_west
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the computation defined in ``area_statistics`` is performed. When it is "north_south" and ``area_statistics`` is "average", "stdev" or "variance" the aggregation is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
    ptype: str
    values: east_west/north_south
- swap_axes:
    default: 'no'
    desc: By default, the definition of the vertical and horizontal axes of the Hovmoeller
      diagrams follows pre-defined rules. However, if ``swap_axes`` is set to 
      "yes" then the axes will be swapped around.
    ptype: str
    values: no/yes
- resolution:
    default: '1.0'
    desc: Used to interpolate the data onto a regular grid, and applies to both the
      horizontal and vertical axes where appropriate. This parameter is essential
      for creating a Hovmoeller diagram from satellite data.
    ptype: number
