oneliner: Defines a shape :ref:`Weather Symbol Object <weather_symbols>`.
params:
- type:
   default: 'line'
   desc: |- 
      Specifies the shape type. This also implicitly specifies the type of data which will be entered. The available types are as follows:
      
      * "line": straight line in all the projections
      * "polyline": points connected with straight lines in all the projections
      * "curve": points connected with a B-spline curve
      * "polygon": points forming a closed shape, connected with straight lines in all the projections
      * "closed_curve": points forming a closed shape, connected with a B-Spline curve
      * "rectangle": rectangle with straight edges. The corner points will be adjusted when the projection changes to preserve the rectangular shape.
      * "proj_line": a line sampled in lat-lon. The shape changes according to the projection.
      * "proj_polyline": points connected with edges sampled in lat-lon. The edge shapes change according to the projection.
      * "proj_polygon": points forming a closed shape, with edges sampled in lat-lon. The edge shapes change according to the projection.
      * "proj_quad": a lat-lon rectangle with edges sampled in lat-lon. The shape changes into various quadrilaterals according to the current projection.

   ptype: str
- line:
   default: 'on'
   desc: Enable to draw the line/outline.
   values: on/off
   ptype: str
- line_colour:
   default: 'black'
   desc: Colour of the line/outline. Enabled when ``line`` is "on".
   values: ''
   ptype: str
- line_thickness:
   default: '1'
   desc: Thickness of the line/outline. Enabled when ``line`` is "on".
   ptype: number
- line_style:
   default: 'solid'
   desc: Style of the line/outline. Enabled when ``line`` is "on".
   values: solid/dash/dot/dash_dot/dash_dot_dot
   ptype: line_style
- line_start_ptype:
   default: 'none'
   desc: Defines the arrow head for the start of the line. Enabled when ``type`` is "line", "polyline", "curve", "proj_line" or "proj_polyline".
   values: none/open_arrow/filled_arrow
   ptype: str
- line_end_ptype:
   default: 'none'
   desc: Defines the arrow head for the end of the line. Enabled when ``type`` is "line", "polyline", "curve", "proj_line" or "proj_polyline".
   values: none/open_arrow/filled_arrow
   ptype: str
- arrow_length:
   default: '10'
   desc: The length of the arrow head. Enabled when either ``line_start_ptype`` or `line_end_ptype`` is not 'none'.
   ptype: number
- fill:
   default: 'on'
   desc: Enable to fill the shape.
   values: on/off
   ptype: str
- fill_colour:
   default: 'rgba(0,0,1,0.3)'
   desc: Fill colour of the shape. Enabled when ``fill`` is "on".
   values: ''
   ptype: str
- segment_dateline_cross:
   desc: special

- x:
   default: '0'
   desc: |-
      The x coordinates of the points making up the shape. The number of points required depends on the ``type``:
      
      * For "line" and "proj_line" exactly 2 points are needed. 
      * For "polyline", "curve" and "proj_polyline" minimum 2 points are needed. 
      * For "polygon", "closed_curve" and "proj_polygon" minimum 3 points are needed.
      * For "rectangle" and "proj_quad" exactly 4 points are needed. 
   ptype: ndarray or list of numbers
- y:
   default: '0'
   desc: The y coordinates of the points making up the shape.  For the number of points required please see ``x``.
