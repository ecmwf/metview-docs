return: :class:`Request`
summary: Combines scalar GRIB fields (:class:`Fieldset`) into vector fields for
  the purpose of **plotting**\ . The user supplies GRIB data of vector X and Y components
  (cartesian coordinates) or intensity/direction (polar coordinates) with
  the option of colouring the vectorial representation (arrows) according to
  the magnitude of a user supplied scalar quantity. The classic example is to plot a wind
  field from u/v components coloured according to temperature.

params:
- type:
    default: vector_field
    desc: Specifies the type of the vector field to make. When it is set to "vector_field" 
      the result is defined by ``u_component`` and ``v_component``. Otherwise when the value is "polar_field"
      the result is defined by ``intensity`` and ``direction``.
    ptype: str
    values: vector_field/polar_field
- u_component:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the :class:`Fieldset` to be used as the vector field's x component.
      Available when ``type`` is "vector_field".
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
- v_component:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the :class:`Fieldset` to be used as the vector field's y component.
      Available when ``type`` is "vector_field".
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
- intensity:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the :class:`Fieldset` to be used as the vector field's intensity component.
      Available when ``type`` is "polar_field".
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
- direction:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the :class:`Fieldset` to be used as the vector field's direction component.
      Available when ``type`` is "polar_field".
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
- colouring_field:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the :class:`Fieldset` that the colouring is based on. If not supplied, the
      computed magnitude of the vector components will be used for colouring. 
    ptype: :class:`Fieldset`
    values: ''
