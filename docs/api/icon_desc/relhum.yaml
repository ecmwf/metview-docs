return: :class:`Fieldset`
summary: |-
  Computes the relative humidity from temperature, specific humidity
  and logarithm of surface pressure (LNSP) GRIB data. LNSP is only required
  if the input data is specified on ECMWF model levels.
  
  When the result is a :class:`Fieldset` the ecCodes **paramId** in the output is set to 157 (=relative humidity).
    
  The computation is based on the following formula:

  .. math:: 
      
        r = 100 \frac {e(q, p)}{e_{msat}(t)}

  where:

  * e is the vapour pressure (see :func:`vapour_pressure`)
  * e\ :sub:`msat` is the saturation vapour pressure based on the "mixed" phase (see :func:`saturation_vapour_pressure`)
  * q is the specific humidity
  * p is the pressure
  * t is the temperature

    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the temperature and specific humidity input GRIB data required for 
      the application. If the input is defined on ECMWF (hybrid/eta) model levels it 
      must contain a Logarithm of Surface Pressure field as well (it must have 
      the ecCodes paramId of 152).
