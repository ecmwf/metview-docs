- type:
    default: line_hovm
    desc: |-
        Specifies the type of the Hovmoeller diagram to be produced. Options are:
        
        * "area_hovm": diagram derived from an input rectangular area
        * "line_hovm": diagram derived from an input transect line.
        * "vertical_hovm": diagram derived from an input rectangular area and a set of levels.
    ptype: str
    values: line_hovm/area_hovm/vertical_hovm
- input_mode:
    default: area
    desc: |-
      Defines the horizontal data selection method for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams. Enabled when ``type`` is "vertical_hovm". The possible options are as follows:

      * "point": the data is interpolated to the location specified by ``point``
      * "nearest_gridpoint": the nearest gridpoint to the location specified by ``point`` is extracted
      * "area": the values inside the ``area`` are averaged using :func:`integrate`

      *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    type: str
    values: point/nearest_gridpoint/area
- point:
    default: '0/0'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates (as [lat, lon]) of the point for which the vertical Hovmoeller
      is computed. Enabled when ``type`` is "vertical_hovm"  and ``input_mode`` is "point" or "nearest_gridpoint". *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- line:
    default: '0/-180/0/180'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of a transect line along which the Hovmoeller
         diagram is calculated in [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2] format. Enabled when ``type`` is "line_hovm".
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- area: 
    default: '30/-30/-30/30'
    desc: Specifies the coordinates of the area (as [north, west, south, east]) over
      which the Hovmoeller diagram is calculated. Enabled when ``type`` is "area_hovm" or 
      "vertical_hovm" (and ``input_mode`` is "area").
    ptype: list[number]
    values: ''
- area_statistics:
    default: 'average'
    desc: |-
        Specifies the type of computation performed in the ``area``:

        * when ``type`` is "area_hovm" it is a computation along the ``average_direction``.  For "average", "stdev" or "variance" when ``average_direction`` is "north_south" the aggregation is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes.
        * when ``type`` is "vertical_hovm" and ``input_mode`` is "area" it is a computation performed on all the gridpoints in the ``area``. For "average", "stdev" or "variance" the aggregation is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes. 
        Enabled when ``type`` is "area_hovm" or  "vertical_hovm" (and ``input_mode`` is "area"). 
    ptype: str
    values: average/minimum/maximum/stdev/variance/median    
- average_direction:
    default: east_west
    desc: Specifies the direction along which the computation defined in ``area_statistics`` is performed. When it is "north_south" and ``area_statistics`` is "average", "stdev" or "variance" the aggregation is weighted by the cosine of the latitudes. Enabled when ``type`` is "area_hovm".
    ptype: str
    values: east_west/north_south
- time_axis_mode:
    default: user
    desc: |-
        Specifies the direction of the date/time axis. The options are as follows:

        * "user": left/bottom date is taken from ``date_min`` and the right/top date is taken from ``date_max``.
        * "automatic_forwards": date limits are taken from the data and plotted left to right or bottom to top.
        * "automatic_backwards": date limits are taken from the data and plotted right to left or top to bottom. This option has the same effect as "user" with default ``date_min`` and ``date_max``.
    ptype: str
    values: automatic_forwards/automatic_backwards/user
- date_min:
    default: automatic
    desc: Specifies the horizontal date minimum value. Default value "automatic"
      indicates that the minimum value will be taken from the input data.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- date_max:
    default: automatic
    desc: Specifies the horizontal date maximum value. Default value "automatic"
      indicates that the maximum value will be taken from the input data.
    ptype: str
    values: ''
- bottom_level:
    default: '1015.0'
    desc:  Specifies the lower (closest to the surface) limit of the Hovmoeller data in the units of the vertical coordinates. Only levels in the range defined by ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` are included in the output data. An extra level on either side of this range is also added. Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure" or "param".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- top_level:
    default: '0.01'
    desc: Specifies the upper (furthest from the surface) limit of the Hovmoeller data in the units of the vertical coordinates. Only levels in the range defined by ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` are included in the output data. An extra level on either side of this range is also added. Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure" or "param".
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- swap_axes:
    default: 'no'
    desc: By default, the definition of the vertical and horizontal axes of the Hovmoeller
      diagrams follows pre-defined rules. However, if ``swap_axes`` is set to 
      "yes" then the axes will be swapped around.
    ptype: str
    values: no/yes
- resolution:
    default: '1.0'
    desc: Used to interpolate the data onto a regular grid, and applies to both the
      horizontal and vertical axes where appropriate. This parameter is essential
      for creating a Hovmoeller diagram from satellite data.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- time_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: |-
        Specifies the characteristics of the time-series axis as an :func:`maxis` object to be used in the plotting of the data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should not change their values directly: ``axis_type`` (set to "date"), ``axis_date_min_value`` and ``axis_date_max_value`` (set according to ``date_min`` and ``date_max``, respectively), and ``axis_orientation``. The ``axis_orientation`` parameter is defined according to the following rules:
                 
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", the value is set to "horizontal".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and `average_direction`` is "east_west", the value is set to "horizontal".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "vertical_hovm", the value is set to "horizontal".
        However, it is possible to change ``axis_orientation`` value from its calculated default by setting ``swap_axes`` to "yes". This option is not available for "vertical_hovm".
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- geo_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: |-
        Specifies the characteristics of the geographical axis as an :func:`maxis` object to be used in the plotting of the data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should not change their values directly: ``axis_min_value`` and ``axis_max_value`` (set according to ``line`` or ``area`` ), ``axis_type``, ``axis_tick_label_type`` and ``axis_orientation``. The ``axis_type`` and ``axis_tick_label_type`` parameters are defined according to the following rules:
        
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", ``axis_type`` is set to "geoline".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "east_west", ``axis_type`` is set to "regular" and "axis_tick_label_type`` to "latitude".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south", ``axis_type`` is set to "regular" and ``axis_tick_label_type`` to "longitude".
        Moreover, ``axis_orientation`` parameter is defined according to the following rules:
        
        * if ``type`` is "line_hovm", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "east_west", the value is set to "vertical".
        * if ``type`` is "area_hovm" and ``average_direction`` is "north_south" the value is set to "horizontal"
        However, it is possible to change the ``axis_orientation`` from its calculated default by setting ``swap_axes`` to "yes".

- vertical_axis:
    default: ''
    desc: >-
        Specifies the characteristics of the level-series axis to be used in the plotting of the
        data. The following :func:`maxis` parameters are defined by the application; therefore, users should 
        not change their values directly: ``axis_min_value`` and ``axis_max_value`` (set according to
        the input data set), ``axis_type``, ``axis_tick_label_type`` and ``axis_orientation``.
    ptype: :func:`maxis`
    values: ''
- vertical_level_type:
   default: as_in_data
   desc: |-
      Specifies the output vertical level type for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams. Enabled when ``type`` is "vertical_hovm". The possible options are as follows:

      * "as_in_data": the level type of ``data`` is used. In this case ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` must always be set carefully, since their default values are set for pressure in hPa.
      * "pressure": indicates that the ``data`` is defined on ECMWF model levels and the output vertical coordinate should be pressure in hPa. When this option is selected the input data must contain the corresponding Logarithm of Surface Pressure (LNSP) fields, unless a fixed surface pressure is used (see ``use_fixed_surface_pressure``).
      * "user": the vertical coordinates (both input and output) are defined by the fields of ``vertical_coordinate_param``. In this case ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` must always be set carefully, since their default values are set for pressure in hPa. *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
   ptype: str

- lnsp_param:
    default: '152'
    desc: Specifies the ecCodes paramId used to identify the Logarithm of Surface Pressure (LNSP) in the input data. Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure". 
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- use_fixed_surface_pressure:
    default: 'off'
    desc: When it is "on" a fixed surface pressure value will be used in the computations and no LNSP fields have to be specified. Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure". *New in Metview version 5.17.0*
    ptype: str
    values: 'on/off' 
- fixed_surface_pressure:
    default: 1013.25
    desc: Specify the fixed surface pressure value in hPa when ``use_fixed_surface_pressure`` is "on".  Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure". *New in Metview version 5.17.0*
    ptype: number
    values: ''      
- vertical_coordinate_param:
    default: ''
    desc: Specifies the ecCodes paramId used to identify the vertical coordinate fields in the input data.  Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "user". *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    ptype: number
    values: '' 
- vertical_coordinate_extrapolate:
    default: 'off'
    desc: Performs and extrapolation for the ``top_level`` and ``bottom_level`` when the output vertical level range does not contain these levels. Only used for vertical Hovmoeller diagrams (``type`` is "vertical_hovm") when ``vertical_level_type`` is "pressure" or "user". The purpose is to avoid blank areas in the plot near the bottom ot top. *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    ptype: str
    values: on/off
- vertical_coordinate_extrapolate_mode:
    default: 'constant'
    desc: Specifies the extrapolation technique. In "constant" mode the values on the nearest input levels are copied onto the target extrapolated levels. In "linear" mode a linear extrapolation is performed using the nearest two input levels. Enabled when ``vertical_coordinate_extrapolate`` is "on". *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    ptype: str
    values: constant/linear  
- vertical_coordinate_extrapolate_fixed_sign:
    default: 'on'
    desc: When ``vertical_coordinate_extrapolate_mode`` is "on" it controls whether the extrapolated values can differ in sign from the values on the nearest input levels. When it is "on" it prevents e.g. wind components to change sign due to extrapolation. *New in Metview version 5.16.0*
    ptype: str
    values: on/off   
- vertical_scaling:

    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_position:
    default: '10'
    desc: Specifies the Y offset of the plot from the bottom side of the plot frame
      (any subdivision of the display area). This is expressed as a percentage of
      the Y-dimension of the plot frame.
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_x_length:
    default: '75'
    desc: Specifies the X length of the plot. This is expressed as a percentage of
      the X-dimension of the plot frame. Hence the sum of this X length plus the X
      offset cannot exceed 100 (it is advised that it does not exceed 95 since you
      need some margin on the right for things like axis or map grid labels).
    ptype: number
    values: ''
- subpage_y_length:
    default: '80'
    desc: Same as ``subpage_x_length`` but for the Y length of the plot.
