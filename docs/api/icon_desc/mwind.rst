This is the visual definition for specifying how vector data is displayed. It controls features such as wind arrows and wind flags. Note that Metview will automatically interpret certain pairs of GRIB parameters as vector components, for example u/v and 10u/10v. Use :func:`grib_vectors` to plot an arbitrary pair of scalar fields as a vector field.  

.. note::
    
    The list of available arrow head styles can be found :ref:`here <resource_wind_arrow_heads>`.
