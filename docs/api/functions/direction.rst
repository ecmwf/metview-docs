direction
==============

.. py:function:: direction(u, v)

   Computes the meteorological wind direction in degrees in each grid point of ``u`` and ``v``.

   :param u: u wind component
   :type u: :class:`Fieldset`
   :param v: v wind component
   :type v: :class:`Fieldset`
   :rtype: :class:`Fieldset`

   The meteorological wind direction is the direction from which the wind is blowing. Wind direction increases
   clockwise such that a northerly wind is 0째, an easterly wind is 90째, a southerly wind is 180째, and
   a westerly wind is 270째. The figure below illustrates how it is related to the actual orientation of the wind vector.
