.. py:function:: flexpart_convert_trajectory(raw_tr_file, outprefix)

    Converts the raw trajectory file generated by FLEXPART into CSV format better suited to processing with Metview.

    :param str raw_tr_file: raw trajectory file generated by FLEXPART

    :rtype: None

    
    There is a separate CSV file produced for each FLEXPART release. The output file name convention is as follows::
