**Metview** is a meteorological workstation application designed to be a complete working environment
for both the operational and research meteorologist. Its capabilities include powerful data access,
processing and visualisation. It features both a powerful **icon-based user interface** for
interactive work and a **Python** interface for batch processing.

Metview was developed as part of a cooperation between ECMWF and INPE (Brazilian National Institute for Space Research).
