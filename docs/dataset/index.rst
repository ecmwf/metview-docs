Dataset
====================================

A dataset is a collection of **data files** (GRIB and CSV) and a set of **predefined styles** to visualise the data. Using a dataset is a convenient way to set up a training course or create a use case you want to share with others. The dataset interface was originally created for working with OpenIFS use cases in Jupyter notebooks.
